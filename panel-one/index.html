Bibo (Bee-Bow)
  </h1>
  
    <p id="introwords">
      Bibo is a black lab. 11 years of age. My childhood dog I took to college with me. I like to describe Bibo's life now, compared to the beginning years of his life, sort of like his "retirement" life. Since living in Athens, Bibo has experienced much more life than he could have ever imagined. He has met new friends, gone on endless car rides and even trained for a half marathon with me. Needless to say, Bibo lives an extrodinary life and is also super cute. So why not share?

      These names are important to note because more often than not Bibo will forget his name. Not sure if it is selective hearing or if he is still learning.

      I like to do pretty much everything with Bibo. He goes with me on pretty much an errand he is able to join. We go on constant walks together, trying out any park and trail that we find. We also like to study together outside at pet-friendly coffee shops. My current favorite is Buvez. We also love to travel together and go see friends in other cities!
